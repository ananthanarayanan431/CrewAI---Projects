Dear Ringo,

Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm happy to help you with your question. However, I want to clarify that your question about not being able to sing seems a bit unusual. Could you please provide more context or information about what you mean by "Why can't I get to sing?"? Are you referring to a specific situation or issue you're facing? I want to make sure I understand your concern correctly so I can provide a helpful response.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Sarah the Resident Manager
